In this part of our journey, we going to see two breakthoughts as Microsoft Azure Products, Polyglot Database and Container Orchestration.



### Polyglot Persistence

### Azure CosmosDB

When we research about data, the term polyglot persistence is something usual in our daily basis, companies now need to store data in different formats and extract the best of each engine available.
Thinking about this term, we have Azure CosmosDB, A Polyglot Database geo-redudant, which gives the best of many work in one platform.

* SQL & NoSQL
* Polyglot Database
* Azure CosmosDB
* Use-cases

Using Azure CosmosDB we will use an application to insert data inside CosmosDB NoSQL API, this will make more easy the understanding of how the engine works, besides that we will delve in how it work under the hood.

### Kubernetes

### Azure Kubernetes Services

When we talk about technological breakthrough, Kubernetes is the first to thing that comes to our mind nowdays, in this part of the training we will understand more about Kubernetes as Data Engineers.
Delve into Azure Kubernetes Services, and see how I can have complete full stack of Big Data Products in one place.

* Container vs VMs
* Orchestration
* Azure Kubernetes Services [AKS]
* Features

Using AKS we will understand how the deployment works, the main concepts we need to have to start work in development environment and thinking about decreasing costs.


[Bonus] - We will show one last thing in today's class!
